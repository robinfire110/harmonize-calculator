# Harmonize Calculator - [harmnize.com](harmnize.com)
Harmonize Calculator allows the user to calculate expenses for music gigs based on pay, travel, practice hours etc. Outside of the basic calculation, the apps has several other features...
* Automatic calculation of travel distance and time using Google Maps API.
* Database of up-to-date average gas prices using the [AAA Daily Average Site](https://gasprices.aaa.com/state-gas-price-averages/).
* Ability to export calculations as a functional Excel spreadsheet.
* Signing in with Google SSO allowing you to save calculations, manage previous results, export multiple results into one spreadsheet and set calculator default values.

The application is a cut down version of [Harmonize](https://github.com/robinfire110/music-gig-app), isolating the calculator feature and expanding on it. The original Harmonize was developed by Andy Bonola, Craig Smith and Andy Villasmil as a Senior Capstone project. The work to spin it off into this project was done by Andy Villasmil (robinfire110).

## How to Use
1. Start by inputting your Pay per gig and Hours per gig to get a basic hourly wage.
2. Add more information about your gig such as travel, additional hours, tax or any other expenses.
3. Save your results to your account or export them to a spreasheet by clicking the Save or Export buttons.

## Tips
* You can turn individual fields on/off to see how they affect your final result.
* Have multiple gigs or services? Use the Number of Gigs option to multiply your values. Use the Options button to change which fields get multiplied depending on your needs.
* Don't know the exact distance of the gig? Click the Use Location button to automatically calculate your travel mileage and hours using zip codes.
* Don't know your exact gas price per mile? Click the Use Average button to use average gas prices and vehicle MPG values.
